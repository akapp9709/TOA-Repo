Clive's Phoenix abilities include a Shift, this instantly closes the gap between the player and the targeted enemy. Phoenix Shift is also directional to some extent and is much weaker than Noctis' Point warp from Final Fantasy XV but with the added flexibility of deciding what Clive's follow-up attack should be. 

Clive's arsenal of attacks is massive compared to [[NieR Automata |2B]] with the added abilities of Eikons and his designed combat versatility.
