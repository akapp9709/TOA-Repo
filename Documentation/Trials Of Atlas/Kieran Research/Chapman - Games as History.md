Chapman speaks first of his experiences playing COD: World at War and how the experience put D Day into perspective for him. This lead to his understanding that games are often rooted in some historical aspect and some even teach complex ideas such as societal structure, culture, and historical events.

Chapman states that History appears to be declining in the eyes of public interest, however this History refers to proper history and not the history of popular culture or very specific fields such as music, art, or video games. This distinction shows everything to be a form of History, not just the content of an academic textbook.

History is not a perfect representation of the past. While it is rooted in facts, the gaps are filled in with sensationalizing ideas that make the history flow better, or ideas are skewed in translatiopn, incorrectly interpreted or simply reworded tio meet an agenda. The written word is especially susceptible to this faults, images can be misinterpreted but the original image cannot be lost in translation. Academic history, written in accademic texts, is largely built on the spoken word or the word of others, meaning that objective truth is almost impossible as a result of a single paper.
	 - It seems to me that the possibility exists for fiction to function in truth,  
for a fictional discourse to induce effects of truth, and for bringing  
it about that a true discourse engenders or ‘manufactures’ something  
that does not as yet exist, that is, ‘fictions’ it. One ‘fictions’ history on  
the basis of a political reality that makes it true, one ‘fictions’ a politics  
not yet in existence on the basis of a historical truth. (1980, 193
While fiction is considered to be completely made up and works of creativity, most ficvtion is steeped in or based off historical events or the current state of the world - beit politics, pop culture, or international relations. With that in mind fiction can be used to convey meaning over straight facts - lessons, metaphors and anecdotes within the narrative can provide a new perspective on the position we are currently in.
The collective memory is shaoped by current events in the present and puts up a lens between us and how we view the past. This can be like the rose-colored glasses that some people view specific eras, but can also refer to how people can be looking back with disdain for the time they have just endured.
