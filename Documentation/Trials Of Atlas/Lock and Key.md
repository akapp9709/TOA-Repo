Lock and Key has the player explore the dungeon to find a varied number of keys to open the boss room. This type of run will award bonus experience based on how few rooms the player enters in their search for the keys.
This will test the player's abilities to find patterns throughout the dungeon and discern the correct rooms to enter and clear.
