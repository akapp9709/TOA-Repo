The game is meant to emulate a training simulation for the player's character. This idea of a training sim means that each run is progress to the player's strength and stats, and can feel slightly generic in its presentation. 
Enemies are presented as training dummies (faceless enemies) so that player's are more akin to racking up high body counts in the name of building strength and clearing the dungeon.
