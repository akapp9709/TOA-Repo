Brute enemies are the beefiest enemy. They have a greater amount of health than other enemy types. Their purpose is to act as the major threat or distraction to the player. 
They will harass the player while other enemies attempt to kill them, the player will want to either deal with them first or clear the rest of the room and leave them for last. 

They will feature high damage attacks that are easily avoidable if the player is paying attention, such as a charge, and a slam, the use of these moves is dependent on the distance to the player.
