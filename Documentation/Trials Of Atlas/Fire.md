Fire damage brings a focus on Damage over Time (DOT), and Area of Effect (AoE) attacks. Fire is useful in most games for crowd control.
Ironic as it sounds, Fire in games often conveys an idea of safety and survivability. Given that the game is a roguelike, the game cannot outright heal the Player, but can be used as a strong way to keep enemies at arms length or as a supporter to allow for damage to multiple enemies.
