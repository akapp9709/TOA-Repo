The dodge is used to evade attacks and create space between player and enemies.

Some games implement timing with dodges to create perfect dodges and counters. [[NieR Automata ||2B]] performs different counters based on the input - light caused a counter with the primary weapon, heavy with the secondary, and ranged caused an explosive counter.

The dodge is interesting given its not directly linked to causing damage. This means that the three elements can be completely unique in their implementation. 

[[Fire]]
- can drop an explosive from where the player began their dodge.
- wall of DOT fire following player's path.
[[Tempest]] can push nearby enemies away and out of the player's path while dodging.
[[Lightning]] can cause the player to blink (teleport) a set radius in the input direction.
