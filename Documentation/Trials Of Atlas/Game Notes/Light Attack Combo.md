This is the bread and butter of the player's damage since there is no cooldown, and can be the most consistent source of damage. 
This is similar to [[NieR Automata ||2B's]] standard light combo with her main weapon. Given the consistency of the damage, the standard light combo is ideal for fast damage (not massive but in consistency) and is often used to build DOT stacks. 

In [[Hades]], Zag's light attacks are best paired with Dionysus' hangover effect which causes poison damage over time that stacks with each hit.

[[Fire]] infused attacks cause stacks of fire DOT to affect the enemy.
[[Lightning]] 
- causes the final attack in the combo to paralyze an enemy for an amount of time.
- Causes chain lighting to spread to random enemies within a given radius.
[[Tempest]] adds knockback to the final attack in the combo - space creation
