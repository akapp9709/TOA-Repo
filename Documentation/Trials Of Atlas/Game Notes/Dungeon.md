The dungeon is a series of encounters following each other. It is where Gideons training takes place as he faces many enemies within while adhering to [[Destiny 2|raid]] mechanics, time crunches or simply just for the run. 

The dungeon will feature varied types of [[Enemies]] in various predetermined formations. While these encounters are predesigned and built, the dungeon itself will be completely different for every run albeit with the same number of rooms. 
There is space for having different types of runs - [[Time Trial]], [[Annihilation]], [[Lock and Key]], and [[Powerless]].
