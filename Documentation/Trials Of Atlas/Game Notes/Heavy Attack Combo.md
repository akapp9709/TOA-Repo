Once more following [[NieR Automata ||2B's]] example, the heavy combo is slower but with higher total damage. This would pair better with either [[Tempest]] for massive damage in a single go, or make up for the slow speed with [[Lightning]] Chain Damage. 

Given the weapon of choice, these attacks would best fit long sweeping attacks followed by a slam attack as standard. [[Tempest]] may change the combo to be a single devastating slam.
