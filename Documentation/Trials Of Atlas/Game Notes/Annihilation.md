Annihilation  dungeons will include a large number of enemies that the player will have to kill. Enemies will need to be killed quickly as rooms will reset after increasing amounts of time, the timer for each room resets when a room is cleared out. 

This will train the player in using the elements effectively in clearing rooms quickly and then making good use of the elements strengths and weaknesses. Bonus experience will be awarded for completing the dungeon in as few resets as possible. 
Resetting will end once all rooms except the boss room are clear, the boss room is closed to the player until the rest of the dungeon is clear of enemies.
