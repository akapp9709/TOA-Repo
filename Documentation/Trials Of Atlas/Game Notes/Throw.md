The throw is the main form of ranged damage, with a greater focus on Gideon's offensive capabilities. The throw causes Gideon to throw his Trident, upon impact or reaching the range extent, Gideon will blink to the trident's position, closing space and allowing Gideon to continue his attack when the space between him and enemies gets too large.

The throw will aim to feel similar to [[Final Fantasy XVI |Clive's]] Phoenix Shift ability with a delayed instant feeling.

[[Fire]] causes Gideon to drop an explosive as he throws the trident and cause an AoE on impact with the targeted enemy.
[[Lightning]] Gideon throws the trident as normal, but attacks all enemies in the direction enroute to the trident. 
[[Tempest]] empowers the throw to pin the targeted enemy to the wall behind them causing damage based on distance travelled upon hitting the wall, Gideon will teleport to the trident to reclaim it.
