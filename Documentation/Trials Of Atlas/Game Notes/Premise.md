Trials of Atlas is an Action Roguelike with the intent of emulating a training programme for the [[Player Character]](PC) whereby they are subjected to a gauntlet of combat training to improve their strength, speed, and endurance through repeated runs of the gauntlet.

The gauntlet refers to a Procedurally Generated [[Dungeon]] that will include a number of rooms filled with combat encounters and possible mechanics similar to [[Destiny 2|Raids]].
