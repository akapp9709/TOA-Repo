The powerless modify removes element pickups from the run. The player must rely on their own skill to complete the dungeon, the dungeon will have a reduced difficulty, but will still present a more challenging experience than the dungeon with elemental pickups.

As a reward for completing a Powerless run, the Player will be awarded with a large experience multiplier to the experience gained during the run. As a result, the player should experience a short spike in power in relation to enemies for the next few runs.
